## FAQ

- Nothing happens after double-clicking the Windows installer
  - Check if Windows Defender has blocked the file.
  - Verify that you are not on Windows 7; it is not supported—Windows 10 or later is required.
  - Ensure you downloaded the correct 32-bit or 64-bit version for your system.
- Mac: very slow on first launch, normal afterward
  - This is a normal phenomenon. On first launch, the app extracts bundled files, which can take several tens of seconds.
