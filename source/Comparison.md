(Since version 2.1.0.0)

Step 2.1 Data Comparison is optional and can be skipped.

Step 2.1 compares the data provided in Step 1 with the content of the Word template uploaded in Step 2, helping users identify errors in the template and offering suggestions for correction.

After the comparison, recommendations for subsequent steps are given; however, regardless of the comparison results, you may skip Step 2.1 and proceed directly to the “Generate Document” button in Step 3.

## Comparison Process

- List the data items provided in Step 1
- List the following placeholders in the Word template uploaded in Step 2
    - Data placeholders
    - Loop placeholders
    - Conditional placeholders
- Compare the two lists and highlight the differences (with color)
- Provide modification suggestions for the differences
- Recommend generation mode (1 or 2)
