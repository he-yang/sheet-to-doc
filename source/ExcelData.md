## Data Preparation

Before using Sheet to Doc, you need to prepare the data that will be converted into documents.

We accept multiple data formats:
- Tab-separated Excel data (regular Excel files)
- Comma-separated Excel data (CSV files)
- JSON
- JSONL

### Data Content

At least two rows and one column of data should be included.

- Tab-separated Excel data
    - The first row is the header row,
    - Subsequent rows are data rows.
- Comma-separated Excel data
    - The first row is the header row,
    - Subsequent rows are data rows.
- JSON
    - Should be an array with at least one element
    - Each element in the array is a JSON object
    - Each JSON object has at least one key-value pair.
- JSONL
    - Each data row is an independent JSON object,
    - Each JSON object has at least one key-value pair.

Examples:

- Tab-separated Excel data
```
    Name    Age    Gender
    Zhang San    25    Male
    Li Si    30    Female
```
- Comma-separated Excel data
```
    Name,Age,Gender
    Zhang San,25,Male
    Li Si,30,Female
```
- JSON
```
    [
        {"Name": "Zhang San", "Age": 25, "Gender": "Male"},
        {"Name": "Li Si", "Age": 30, "Gender": "Female"}
    ]
```
- JSONL
```
    {"Name": "Zhang San", "Age": 25, "Gender": "Male"}
    {"Name": "Li Si", "Age": 30, "Gender": "Female"}
```

- JSON and JSONL
    - Numbers (integers, floating points)
    - Boolean values (TRUE/FALSE)
    - Text (strings)

### Header Row Data Type Requirements

- Tab-separated Excel data and CSV
    - Each cell in the header row must be in text format (data types other than numbers and booleans are considered text strings)
    - Each cell in the header row cannot be empty text (i.e., no content)
    - Header row cell content can be in Chinese, English, and theoretically supports other languages
    - It is not recommended to include empty characters (spaces, tabs, etc.) in single cell content in the header row
    - Content between cells in the header row cannot be duplicated
    - Spaces, @ , hyphens (-) are not allowed in cell content
- JSON and JSONL
    - Each key in the JSON object must be in text string format
    - It is not recommended to include empty characters (spaces, tabs, etc.) in each key of the JSON object
    - Keys in each JSON object cannot be duplicated
    - Spaces, @ , hyphens (-) are not allowed in key


### Data Row Data Type Requirements

- Tab-separated Excel data and CSV
    - Each cell in the data row must contain text, numbers, or boolean values
    - Some cells in the data row can be empty (i.e., no content)
- JSON and JSONL
    - The value of each JSON object can be any data type supported by JSON
    - The value of each JSON object can be empty (i.e., no content)


## Image Preparation

If you want to insert images into the Word document generated by Sheet to Doc, you need to prepare the images.

We accept multiple image formats:
- JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- BMP
- TIFF

Image file size is recommended not to exceed 1MB. It is recommended to compress images using compression tools to reduce file size, otherwise, the generation time will be long and the probability of errors will increase.
